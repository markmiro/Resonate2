          <h1>
            Afraid you won't find a
            developer who can also design?
          </h1>
          <div class="why">
            <h4>Learn one thing and do it well. Why?</h4>
            <p>Normally a person should only be good at one thing. I really believe this. In my case that one thing is knowing how to fuse code and design. This, I was able to achieve by being a basement code monkey since middle school and practicing both crafts. Everything else was secondary, so naturally I lacked royally in the social relm. I never even kissed a girl till I was 21. So, if you're looking for a sharp non-tool who can code and design, I'm your guy.</p>
            <h4>What does it really mean to be a coder / designer?</h4>
            <p>It means I need to be somewhat particular about what I want to be good at to prevent myself from being spread too thin. I'm the wrong guy if you want me to make you a logo despite my expertise in Photoshop and Illustrator. If you want a poster for an event I'm also the wrong guy.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, just becase I can code doesn't mean I'm an expert in databases and computer security. I know the basics. I know about CSRF attacks and SQL injection, and how to prevent them.</p>
            <h4>So what <em>am</em> I good at?</h4>
            <p>I can anticipate where users will have problems using your app. I can also come up with non-confusing alternatives, and implement them. I can see past how an app looks, and know how to make it functional. At the same time, I'm naturally detail oriented. It took time for me to learn how to look past the facade of good typography, layout, and composition.</p>
            <p>One more thing... I like experimental user interfaces. Most of them confuse users or scare them away from a product (think Windows 8), but once in a while something like the iPod clickwheel comes along and changes everything. I like to explore those edge cases, and being able to code means I can test my ideas. So what do you get by working with me? Innovation at the speed of thought. Believe the hype.</p>

              <p>There were very few robust, and fast tools to build upon when I built the app. The screen transitions and all the UI was coded from scratch.</p>
              <p>Building iPhone apps with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript is several times more difficult than doing the same thing for desktop web browsers.</p>
