              <h2>A web app that passes<br>for native</h2>
              <p>There were very few robust, and fast tools to build upon when I built the app. The screen tansitions and all the UI was coded from scratch.</p>
              <p>In the end, however, making the app appear like a native iPhone app proved to be more trouble than it was worth. In any case, I love showing this off because it shows that I can program right up to the limit of what iOS Safari can handle.</p>
              <p>Building iPhone apps with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript is several times more difficult than doing the same thing for desktop web browsers.</p>
