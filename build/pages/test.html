  <p>Many articles have been written on the benefits in store for designers who write. I can testify that they’re endless. Over time, the line that separates writing from speaking, coding and design gradually fades away. Eventually, you realize that they’re simply different forms of communication.</p>

  <h3>I enjoy creating usable, beautiful interfaces</h3>
  <p>I'm not an illustrator, and I don't design icons. But I know enough about typography, composition, and color to turn ideas into beautiful working interfaces.</p>
  <h2>Skill set</h2>
  <p>I'm Mark Miro. I specialize in making your customers happy by making their experience with your website, your online communications, and your online marketing pleasurable. Good experiences for your customers will increase their loyalty, engender trust, and decrease the amount of calls/emails about stupid questions.</p>
  <p>Why you should trust me: I don't have a portfolio to prove it, but I do have the skills. In my previous job I created by user experiences for bleeding edge technologies like voice recognition (think Siri), gestures (think xBox Kinect), and eye tracking. I created these experiences by writing software that would allow people to interact with their computers, their phones, and their tablets in new ways. I worked for a bleeding-edge company to create these experiences. However, I've been passionate about the web since before I hit puberty. I realized I need a change of pace when I started working on web projects on my spare time. There are so many bad websites on the web that I decided to do something about it, and so here I am.</p>
  <h2>Do you have the technical abilites?</h2>
  <p>For sure! I know HTML5, Javascript, Wordpress, and I've even made an iPad app. I learn new technologies as they come out, but my greatest strengths are in knowing how to create intuitive websites</p>
  <h4>Top interests:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Simple flat design</li>
    <li>Innovative user interfaces</li>
    <li>Working with you beyond doing web design, and instead focusing on business solutions</li>
    <li>Consistency</li>
    <li>Clean code</li>
    <li>Actually solving a problem</li>
    <li>web tools and apis</li>
    <li>clever / experimental user interfaces</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I don't do websites. I solve problems. You don't need me because you need a website. You need me because you want to solve a problem. For example, if you're a restaurant you want people to know your hours without going to the restaurant. You also want to make it easy for people to know what you're about, what you serve, and why they should go there. Most websites don't do that. But your website will if you let me build it. This is what will make you stand out amongst the crowd.</p>
  <h2>Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Geometric logo design
      <ul>
        <li>I'm not an Illustrator, but I can make something that looks incredibly professional. If you want an illustration as part of your logo I can hook you up with an amazing designer by tapping into my network</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Basic website setup. If you need to get a website up and running in under a week, or you are uncomfortable using computers in general, this is the service for you. The website will be professional, polished, but not up to my OCD standards. Of all my services I like providing this one the least (yes I have favorites), but very few people can do this better than me, so I feel strongly about letting me help you with this need.</li>
    <li>Minimalist bespoke website design. I will sit down with you, talk to you about what goals you want to accomplish with your site, who you want to reach, and what general look or mood you want to set. When it comes down to it I'm here to listen to your dreams and desires and "just figure it out". I'll keep you posted on my progress so you don't get surprised at the end with something you never wanted. Once I'm done you'll be left with a website that is easy for you to maintain by using a CMS, and easy for another developer to jump in a tweak something in case something happens to me. I care about my work, so I make sure the stuff nobody sees looks good too.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>I believe that beauty translates into functionality</p>
  <h3>Why Uncrunchable</h3>
  <hr/>
  <h3>Choose UN<b>CRUNCH</b>ABLE if...</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You want a website that people can go to, find the information they need in record time, and leave satisfied</li>
    <li>Get potential customers off the fence if they're not sure if they want to do business with you yet</li>
    <li>You want the best possible first impression</li>
    <li>You care about the little details, but wish there was someone you could trush to just take care of them when it comes to technologies you aren't an expert in</li>
    <li>You want someone who will go beyond building a website that "looks good enough" and try to understand your business, your customers, why you're different, and how the website will fit into your overall business strategy</li>
    <li>You want to be confident that if anything happens to me after the website is complete, then you'll be able to find someone to make any changes you want with ease</li>
    <li>You want a website with big sexy images that take over the whole screen. I can do photography, but if you want something amazing I can refer you to someone so good they'll know your socks off.</li>
    <li>You want some who you can throw ideas at and know they have the skill set to make it happen.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Get off this website if:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You still think drop shadows and glossy buttons are cool</li>
    <li>If you think this website looks good: link</li>
    <li>You tend to think EVERYTHING IS IMPORTANT</li>
    <li>You offer plumbing + poodle day care services and you want a website that encompasses both</li>
    <li>You don't think you need a mobile website</li>
    <li>You've never heard of HTML5</li>
    <li>If you tend to say: "I don't care how it looks, I just want it to be functional"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My goal is to one day create the kind of impeccable work that only a few people in the world are capable of. I want to create things that trancsends the sum of it's parts.</p>
