      h2 A web app that passes<br>for native
      p.
        The app feels very native, though none of the UI is native. In fact, the entire thing was built using web technologies.
      p.
        There were very few robust, and fast tools to build upon when I built the app. The screen transitions and all the UI was coded from scratch.
      p.
        Building iPhone apps with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript is several times more difficult than doing the same thing for desktop web browsers.

      h2 Gray, white, gray, white...
      p.
        A unique motif throughout the app is the alternating white and gray sections. No popular apps at the moment of development used alternating stripes to brand the app.
      p.
        The motif can be used for progress bars, or sections or disabled buttons.

      h2 Avoiding the<br>uncanny valley
      p.
        The <em>uncanny valley</em> describes a computer generated rendering of a person. Have you ever looked at a realistic 3D rendering of a human face, but felt something was off about it? That's an image that falls in the uncanny valley.
      p. I wanted to avoid the <em>uncanny valley</em> by making interface components that don't look like anything you would see on iOS or Android, but still behave like native controls.
