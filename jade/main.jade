      Afraid you won't find a
      developer who can also design?
    .why
      h2 About
      p.
        I'm a front-end developer who has built innovative functional prototypes for Intel, Dell, Lenovo, etc... These prototypes incorporate the latest gesture (think Kinect), touch, and voice recognition technology. I also have a patent with my name on it (in the works).

        h4 Learn one thing and do it well
          small So why am I doing two again?
        p.
          Great innovations happen when knowledge from one discipline gets carried over to another. In my case I've decided to focus on fusing code and design. This, I was able to get good at by being a basement code monkey since middle school and practicing both crafts.
        p.
          Everything else was secondary, so naturally I lacked royally in the social relm. Don't worry; I adjusted later in life. So, if you're looking for a sharp non-tool who can code and design, I'm your guy.
        h4.
          What does it really mean to be a coder / designer?
        p.
          It means I need to be somewhat particular about what I want to be good at. My goal is not to be the proverbial jack of all trades. I'm skilled in Photoshop and Illustrator. But that doesn't mean I'll be the best at poster or logo design.
        p.
          On the other hand, just becase I can code doesn't mean I'm an expert in databases and computer security. I know the basics.
        h4.
          So what <em>am</em> I good at?
        p.
           I can anticipate where users will have problems using your app. I can also come up with non-confusing alternatives, and&mdash;importantly&mdash;implement them. I can see past how an app looks, and know how to make it functional. Simultaneously, I'm naturally detail oriented.
        p.
          One more thing... I like experimental user interfaces. Most of them confuse users or scare them away from a product (think Windows 8), but once in a while something like the iPod click wheel comes along and changes everything. I like to explore those edge cases, and being able to code means I can test my ideas. So what do you get by working with me? Innovation at the speed of thought. Believe the hype.

          There were very few robust, and fast tools to build upon when I built the app. The screen transitions and all the UI was coded from scratch.

          Building iPhone apps with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript is several times more difficult than doing the same thing for desktop web browsers.

        h2 Avoiding the<br>uncanny valley
        p.
          The <em>uncanny valley</em> describes a computer generated rendering of a person. Have you ever looked at a realistic 3D rendering of a human face, but felt something was off about it? That's an image that falls in the uncanny valley.
        p. I wanted to avoid the <em>uncanny valley</em> by making interface components that don't look like anything you would see on iOS or Android, but still behave like native controls.

        h2 WYSIWYG on your phone?
        p.
          This is not the first time you've seen a WYSIWYG user interface, but phones are special because there's very little room for UI. To top it off, I attempted this risk during a hackathon. The end result was a simple, clean, and intuitive interface.
        p.
          I decided on using a WYSIWYG UI so that I did not have to create two user interfaces. I don't know why more of these types of user interfaces don't exist on the internet.

         | Skiing is as deadly as Ecstasy*
    .description
      p.
        * The statistic above is designed to turn heads, but it highlights a problem when we compare risk. We know that both skiing and Ecstasy are dangerous, but the statistic about quantifies it. Each activity will increase your risk of death by about 0.5 micromorts. The news media constantly bombards us about unsafe cars, unsafe pigments used in toys, flamable clothes, and so on.
      p.
        We can't just avoid all risk. We need to be smart about it, which is what the micromort unit is for. We can quantify the risk of sudden death between almost any two risky activities. It's not perfect, but the unit finally allows us to make informed decisions about risk.
      p.
        What's funny is that this was made for a health hackathon in Berkeley. If anything, this app is not designed to make people any healthier. Our goal was to raise awareness about the relative risks of different activities.
