        h2 A web app that passes<br>for native
        p.
          There were very few robust, and fast tools to build upon when I built the app. The screen tansitions and all the UI was coded from scratch.
        p.
          In the end, however, making the app appear like a native iPhone app proved to be more trouble than it was worth. In any case, I love showing this off because it shows that I can program right up to the limit of what iOS Safari can handle.
        p.
          Building iPhone apps with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript is several times more difficult than doing the same thing for desktop web browsers.

        p.
          ...the app was to create a hotel booking app that could also be used by voice. The target is busy frequent travellers. Sometimes they might be booking a hotel last minute in their car, and this app is designed to be the solution to that.

        p.
          A unique motif throughout the the app is the alternating white and gray sections. No popular apps at the moment of development used alternating stripes to brand the app.
        p.
          The motif can be used for progress bars, or sections or disabled buttons.

        p.
          Since most resumes are essentially bullet points, this makes for a simple, flexible system to allow anyone to express themselves professionally. Users can also add and remove slides.

        p. New slides are automatically titled as Skills, Experience, or Education to prevent to give users one less thing to decide.

         | Skiing is as deadly as Ecstasy*
    .description
      p.
        * The statistic above is designed to turn heads, but it highlights a problem when we compare risk. We know that both skiing and Ecstasy are dangerous, but the statistic about quantifies it. Each activity will increase your risk of death by about 0.5 micromorts. The news media constantly bombards us about unsafe cars, unsafe pigments used in toys, flamable clothes, and so on.
      p.
        We can't just avoid all risk. We need to be smart about it, which is what the micromort unit is for. We can quantify the risk of sudden death between almost any two risky activities. It's not perfect, but the unit finally allows us to make informed decisions about risk.
      p.
        What's funny is that this was made for a health hackathon in Berkeley. If anything, this app is not designed to make people any healthier. Our goal was to raise awareness about the relative risks of different activities.
