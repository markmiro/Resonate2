    small Porting an old static website<br>to an advanced CMS-driven one

    p.
      The old website was in need of attention. The entire website was hand-coded in PHP. We wanted to reorganize and update the content from the old website, create a new website with a better look, and have a system that is easy for non-programmers to maintain. I took the technical lead and the project was a big success.
